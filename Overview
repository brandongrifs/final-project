Project: Satoshi's List (but in Ethereum)

Overview:
A platform that creates a tokenized reputation system for service workers, specifically in the real estate
industry (ie Angie's List). Users can signup and choose licensed contractors in their area to perform work on their properties,
through smart contracts, with different parameters allowing for early-finish bonuses, delayed payment, auto payment plans, and
time frames for work being done. Once signed, the user is locked in to pay the contractor upon completion of the job, if there
is a dispute, it can be agreed upon in the contract to have a third-party inspector come out to check the work, if not completed
"to industry standards" payment can be voided by the user and the third-party signer. If the work is not done, the worker loses
some reputation tokens that are also taken upon the settlement with the third party. These tokens would intrinsically have value
as most users would prefer to use a reputable contractor, perhaps even have a payout system for these tokens wherein any/some profits
from the app could be set aside in a fund for this purpose (potential to double reward high-performing and long-standing members).

Our original idea was an expanded system in which a user could connect directly to an agent, who would hold reputation tokens, and then
that agent could direct the work to her preferred workers, which are not bound by contract, but also operate under a token-based system.
In this case, the user would be someone desiring to buy or sell a property, and the workers would be the necessary inspectors 
involved in the process (pest control, home inspection) and any construction needed. In this system, the next qualified inspector to 
visit the property to verify the last inspector/workers job. The buyer/his agent could have the final say, and this system could
eventually replace real-estate agents altogether (by automating appointments and choosing workers based on reputation), or at least 
limit their role in the process. 

For delivering the inspection data to the customer (which is all too often not done, or held by the agent only), we could store
all inspection forms in IPFS, where they would be accessible publicly, like the "Carfax" of a building essentially. A buyer could
view all the past work done on a home to see if a given property has a history of pests or any continuous issues with the property.


This could automate the entire property transfer process which could ease the burden not only on everyday homeowners, but also
large real estate investors, and of course the workers themselves would be rewarded based not on who they know in the industry,
but the quality of their work.
